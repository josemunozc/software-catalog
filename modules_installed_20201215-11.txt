All functional annotation data derived from the analysis of transcripts is integrated into a SQLite database which allows fast efficient searching for terms with specific qualities related to a desired scientific hypothesis or a means to create a whole annotation report for a transcriptome.\n\nSee https://github.com/Trinotate/Trinotate.github.io/wiki for further info.\n\nExample data and processes at /apps/genomics/trinotate/3.2.1/Trinotate-Trinotate-v3.2.1/sample_data \n\n"	3.2.1
